# V2 Intake Question Cards

## Build spec for design + product

### 0) Objectives
- Capture one short user story (message + recipient + situation).
- Run 5–8 adaptive swipe cards to infer:
  - Processing Fingerprint (Lead → Next, Mode, Top Frictions)
  - Core Fear fingerprint (Top-3 % for the moment)
- Return:
  - A 3-card "What I meant to say" (WIMTS) chooser (user must pick 1).
  - Then Translation into 4 listener styles (Thinker/Feeler/Sensor/Intuition), with an Advanced toggle to 8 (Te/Ti/Fe/Fi/Se/Si/Ni/Ne).
  - Gate only the bottom half of each Translation box behind a free sign-up.

### 1) Terminology (public labels)
- **Lenses (Perceiving):** Pulse (Se), Spark (Ne), Anchor (Si), Horizon (Ni)
- **Drivers (Deciding):** Forge (Te), Kernel (Ti), Chorus (Fe), Compass (Fi)
- **Frictions (felt "pressure" chips):** Spotlight (Se), Swirl (Ne), Rulebook (Si), Subtext (Ni), Scoreboard (Te), Cross-Exam (Ti), Vibe Check (Fe), Values Check (Fi)
- **Mode:** Outward-led (E-dom) / Inward-led (I-dom)

(Users never see type letters; they see Lead → Next labels and friendly names.)

## Screen 1 — Intake (Story)
- **Screen title:** Help me make this land
- **Prompt field:**
  - Tell me: who you're talking to, what just happened (or the last frustrating moment with them), and what you want them to understand.
  - Give me the story: who, what just happened, and what you need them to understand.
  - "i" helper (always visible): tap to open micro-copy: "Detail helps: your feelings, exact words, frustrations, what you noticed (tone, choices), what you needed, what you felt or thought, the more emotions or thoughts the closer we can get to the way your brain processes.
  - Input type: large multiline text area (min 3 lines; 1,200-char soft cap).
  - Secondary affordances (optional): "Paste text" / "Use voice" buttons (same field).
  - Primary CTA: "Continue" (disabled until ≥ 1 sentence).
  - Privacy micro-copy (footnote): "Your story stays private. It helps us map how your brain processes the moment."

**Notes**
- No other inputs. If the story reads neutral (no heat words), auto-nudge below field: "No heat here? Think of the last frustrating or confusing moment this week (it doesn't have to be with this person) and tell me about that."

## Screen 2 — Swipe flow (cards)
- **Card anatomy:**
  - Question headline (≤8 words).
  - Left option + Right option (≤8 words each).
  - Intensity via gesture: Up = "very much" (+2), Down = "a bit" (+1).
  - "i" helper: one-line clarifier per card (always present).
  - "Neither / Not sure" link under options (adds small smoothing and advances).
  - Live feedback strip (below cards):
    - Two Style chips (current finalists by stack).
    - Top fears mini-bar (fills as %). (No letters, no theory terms.)

### Stack A — Results (Profile) Your Processing Fingerprint
- **Headline chip:** Lead → Next (e.g., "Horizon → Chorus | Guide").
- **Mode pill:** "Inward-led" (I-dom) or "Outward-led" (E-dom).
- **Expanded description:** 2–3 sentences (not a one-liner).
- **Top Frictions (2–3 chips):** e.g., Rulebook • Subtext • Cross-Exam.
- **Core Fear fingerprint:** Top-3 chips + stacked bar with % (e.g., "Powerlessness 28% • Incompetence 22% • Betrayal 18%").
- **Micro-coaching (3 lines):** Superpower • What calms you first • Watch-out.
- **Context capsule (optional):** "In this story we detected…" with 1–2 "fear-story" sentences. (Voice/positioning pulls from your explainer's "processing map" framing: the system shows which "data streams your brain trusted first" in the moment.
- **Auto-collapse X seconds after reveal (keep a chevron to re-open).**

### Stack B — What I meant to say (3-card chooser)
- **Note to AI:** Generate per your separate "What I Meant To Say" Playbook. Do not improvise structure here; follow that document's rules. Produce 3 distinct variants.
- **Card layout (x3):**
  - Title (tiny): Option A / B / C
  - Body: up to ~120 words (per Playbook)
  - Footer actions: Swipe right to choose • "Preview full"
  - Presentation: Show cards in a horizontal carousel with the next card peeking (32–48px). Ensure the bottom edge of all three is visible in the stack's viewport to signal multiple choices.
  - Selection gesture:
    - Swipe right (primary) or Select button → locks chosen variant.
    - On lock, show tiny "Saved" toast, then auto-expand Stack C.
    - Never blurred. Users must choose here.

### Stack C — Translation (populates after B is chosen)
- **Tab row (default = 4-listener set):** Thinker • Feeler • Sensor • Intuition
- **Advanced toggle:** "Show advanced (8)" → tabs switch to Te • Ti • Fe • Fi • Se • Si • Ni • Ne
- **Box layout (for each tab):**
  - Header: "If I'm talking to a Thinker" (or Te, etc.)
  - Body: 2–4 sentences (see §4 templates)
  - Bottom 50% blurred with overlay CTA: "Save your personalized results and see the full message." Buttons: Sign up free (primary) • "Not now" (dismiss keeps blur)

## What the AI must generate

### 3-card "What I meant to say"
- **Source of truth:** Use your "What I Meant To Say" document.
- Produce exactly 3 variants tailored by Lead→Next, top frictions, and fear fingerprint.
- **Distinctness rule:** ensure each variant differs by opening move (human-first vs structure-first vs neutral/bridging) and by request framing.
- **Return:** { option_id, title, body, rationale_tags[] }

### C) Translation boxes (4 or 8 listeners)

#### Option 1 — 4-listener set (default)
- **Thinker (T)** — Explain → Definition → Logic chain → Edge case (1) → Check
  - Opener pattern: "I'm defining X as __ because __. That leads to __. Does that hold?"
- **Feeler (F)** — Belong → Relational safety → Shared aim → Small ask
  - Opener: "I want us okay while we sort this. I'm after __ with you."
- **Sensor (S)** — Concrete → Current facts → Examples/receipts → Next step
  - Opener: "Right now we have __. Last time __ worked. Next, could we __?"
- **Intuition (N)** — Pattern → Why/through-line → Options → Preferred path → Invite
  - Opener: "This fits a pattern: __ → __. Options are __; I'd choose __. Thoughts?"

#### Option 2 — 8-listener set (Advanced)
- **Te (Execute / Planner)** — Outcome → Owner → When → Risk/mitigation
  - "Bottom line: we hit __. I'll own __ by __; risk is __ so we'll __."
- **Ti (Explain / Analyzer)** — Definition → Premise → Inference → Counterexample (1)
  - "Define X as __; given __, then __. If __, we adjust by __."
- **Fe (Belong / People-First)** — Acknowledge → We-goal → Smooth path → Small ask
  - "I want us okay. I'm aiming for __ with you. Could we try __ now?"
- **Fi (Align / Values-First)** — Value → Integrity check → Choice
  - "This matters because __. What feels true to me is __. Would __ work for you?"
- **Se (Realtime / Hands-On)** — What's happening now → Try it → Show result
  - "Right now we're at __. Let's try __ and see __."
- **Si (Reliable / Tried-&-True)** — What's worked → Steps → Consistency
  - "Last time __ worked. Let's use the same steps: __ → __."
- **Ni (Through-Line / Trajectory)** — Meaning → Trajectory → Focused step
  - "This points to __. If we keep that line, next is __."
- **Ne (Options / Explore)** — Reframe → 2–3 options → Pick one
  - "Another way to see it is __. We could __, __, or __; I'd start with __."

### Common generation rules (both 4 and 8):
- Use the selected "What I meant to say" content as the base; do not contradict it.
- Replace nouns/verbs to match the listener without changing the ask.
- If a Top Friction is Rulebook or Subtext, subtly address it:
  - Rulebook → add receipts/steps; Subtext → make the implication explicit once.
- Keep it 2–4 sentences, ~45–90 words. No jargon, no therapy terms.

## 5) Microcopy to swap in (changed/added)
- **Intake label:** as in §1
- **Accordion headers:**
  - A: Your Processing Fingerprint
  - B: What I meant to say
  - C: Translation
- **B stack card footer:** Swipe right to choose • Preview full
- **C stack tabs:** Thinker • Feeler • Sensor • Intuition • (toggle →) Show advanced (8)
- **Blur overlay CTA (C stack):** "Sign up free to save your personalized results and reveal the full message."

## 6) Interaction & gating rules (so devs know)
- **Population order:** C (Translation) does not render until B has a selected option_id.
- **Blur scope:** only the bottom 50% of each Translation box is blurred; the top half remains readable so the user knows value is there.
- **Analytics events:**
  - intake_submitted, card_answered (with intensity), result_rendered,
  - what_i_meant_option_viewed, what_i_meant_option_selected,
  - translation_tab_viewed (thinker/feeler/sensor/intuition or Te/Ti/… ),
  - signup_modal_shown, signup_completed, reveal_unlocked.
- **Accessibility:** blur must be screen-reader safe (aria-label "Partially hidden—sign up to reveal.")

## 3) Screen B — Adaptive Swipe Flow (5–8 cards)
Gestures: Left = A, Right = B; Up = "very much" (+2), Down = "a bit" (+1). Always show: "i" helper (1-line clarifier), and "Neither / Not sure" (adds +0.5 smoothing to both sides, then advances). Live feedback strip (under each card): two Style chips (current finalists), mini fear bar (Top-3 %), no jargon.

### Card Bank (copy + mapping)

#### Q1 — Pressure kind (live vs unknown)
**Headline:** Which pressure felt bigger?
- **Left:** Put on the spot now <sub>Eyes on me / answer now</sub> → Se +1.0×int Fear: +Powerlessness .4, +Incompetence .3, +Unworthy .2, +Chaos .1
- **Right:** Too many moving parts <sub>Shifting plan / unclear path</sub> → Ne +1.0×int Fear: +Chaos .45, +Incompetence .25, +Powerlessness .2, +Betrayal .1

#### Q2 — Judgment style (proof vs meaning)
**Headline:** What kind of judgment landed?
- **Left:** Wanted exact steps & proof <sub>Receipts, follow-through</sub> → Si +1.0×int Fear: +Confinement .4, +Unworthy .3, +Incompetence .2, +Abandonment .1
- **Right:** Made it about what this means <sub>Implications about you/us</sub> → Ni +1.0×int Fear: +Incompetence .35, +Unworthy .25, +Confinement .2, +Betrayal .2

#### Conditional card (ask only if Q1/Q2 weak/ambiguous):
- **Q2b — Numbers vs logic** Left: Measured by numbers (Scoreboard) → Te +1.0×int Fear: +Incompetence .5, +Chaos .3, +Powerlessness .2 Right: Picked apart on logic (Cross-Exam) → Ti +1.0×int Fear: +Incompetence .5, +Unworthy .3, +Confinement .2
- **Q2c — Social tone vs values** Left: Tone / approval in the room (Vibe Check) → Fe +1.0×int Fear: +Abandonment .5, +Unlovable .3, +Betrayal .2 Right: Value / moral judgment (Values Check) → Fi +1.0×int Fear: +Unworthy .5, +Betrayal .3, +Abandonment .2

#### Pair Selection Rule (after Q1–Q2 ± Q2b/c):
Pick the largest pressure bucket (Se/Ne/Si/Ni/Te/Ti/Fe/Fi) → map to inferior → get a 2-type pair:
- Si → ENFP / ENTP
- Se → INFJ / INTJ
- Ne → ISFJ / ISTJ
- Ni → ESFP / ESTP
- Fi → ENTJ / ESTJ
- Ti → ENFJ / ESFJ
- Fe → INTP / ISTP
- Te → INFP / ISFP

#### Q4 — Pair split (choose the variant that matches the pair)
Award +4 (Up) / +2 (Down) to chosen type; runner-up +1. Also apply fear crosswalk by chosen function.
- ENFP vs ENTP → Seen on values (Fi) ⟷ Make the model click (Ti)
- INFJ vs INTJ → Make the room okay (Fe) ⟷ Lock owners & steps (Te)
- ISFJ vs ISTJ → Loop the right people (Fe) ⟷ Checklist & handoffs (Te)
- ESFP vs ESTP → 'You missed the human' (Fi) ⟷ 'Logic was flimsy' (Ti)
- ENTJ vs ESTJ → Clear long-path direction (Ni) ⟷ Proven steps & examples (Si)
- ENFJ vs ESFJ → Sense the bigger pattern (Ni) ⟷ What's worked before (Si)
- INTP vs ISTP → 'What else could this be?' (Ne) ⟷ 'Let me try it' (Se)
- INFP vs ISFP → Try more angles (Ne) ⟷ See/touch it now (Se)

#### Q5 — Fear lock (connection vs competence)
- **Left:** Unwanted / not included → +Abandonment .6, +Unlovable .4
- **Right:** Not capable / not right → +Incompetence .6, +Unworthy .4

#### Tie-breakers (only if needed):
- **Q6 — Freedom vs stability** Left: My freedom got boxed → +Confinement .7, +Powerlessness .3 Right: This felt unstable / risky → +Chaos .7, +Powerlessness .3
- **Q7 — Agency vs trust** Left: Let me choose/shape → +Powerlessness .7, +Incompetence .3 Right: Assure good intent / keep promise → +Betrayal .8, +Unlovable .2
- **Q8 — Summary confirm (only if Type confidence <70% or Top-2 fears ≤2 pts)** Right = Accept, Left = See runner-up (swap & lock)

Type confidence: winner / (winner+runner-up) × 100.

## 3) Scoring model (what the AI does)
Buckets: 8 "pressure" (Se/Ne/Si/Ni/Te/Ti/Fe/Fi), 16 type buckets, 8 core-fear buckets.
Intensity: Up=2, Down=1. "Neither" gives +0.5 smoothing to both sides where applicable.

### 3.1 Function pressure (from Q1/Q2/Q2b/Q2c)
- Q1: Left→Se +1.0×int; Right→Ne +1.0×int.
- Q2: Left→Si +1.0×int; Right→Ni +1.0×int.
- Q2b: Left→Te +1.0×int; Right→Ti +1.0×int.
- Q2c: Left→Fe +1.0×int; Right→Fi +1.0×int.

### 3.2 Type narrowing
- After Q1–Q2 (±Q2b/c), pick largest pressure bucket → inferior → 2-type pair.
- Q4 (pair split): winner +4 (Up) / +2 (Down); runner-up +1.
- Type confidence = winner / (winner + runner-up) × 100.

### 3.3 Core Fear crosswalk (weights)
- Q1 (Se vs Ne): Se→ +Powerlessness .4, +Incompetence .3, +Unworthy .2, +Chaos .1 Ne→ +Chaos .45, +Incompetence .25, +Powerlessness .2, +Betrayal .1
- Q2 (Si vs Ni): Si→ +Confinement .4, +Unworthy .3, +Incompetence .2, +Abandonment .1 Ni→ +Incompetence .35, +Unworthy .25, +Confinement .2, +Betrayal .2
- Q2b (Te vs Ti): Te→ +Incompetence .5, +Chaos .3, +Powerlessness .2 Ti→ +Incompetence .5, +Unworthy .3, +Confinement .2
- Q2c (Fe vs Fi): Fe→ +Abandonment .5, +Unlovable .3, +Betrayal .2 Fi→ +Unworthy .5, +Betrayal .3, +Abandonment .2
- Q4 (chosen aux): Fe→ Abandonment .5, Unlovable .3, Betrayal .2 Te→ Incompetence .5, Chaos .3, Powerlessness .2 Fi→ Unworthy .5, Betrayal .3, Abandonment .2 Ti→ Incompetence .5, Unworthy .3, Confinement .2
- Q5–Q7: as phrased in the cards above.

Display: Normalize fears → %; show Top-3 chips + stacked bar with labels (language matches your explainer: "data streams you trust first" / "core wound fears").

## 4) Screen C — Results Accordion

### Stack A — Your Processing Fingerprint (auto-open, then auto-collapse)
- **Header chip:** Lead → Next (e.g., Horizon → Forge | Strategist) + Mode pill.
- **Description:** 2–3 sentences (not a one-liner), broad enough to avoid boxing users in.
- **Top Frictions:** 2–3 chips (highest pressure inputs).
- **Core Fear fingerprint:** Top-3 chips + stacked % bar.
- **Behavior:** Auto-collapse 3s after render (or on scroll). Chevron to reopen.

### Stack B — What I meant to say (3-card chooser)
- **Source:** Use your WIMTS Playbook for generation (AI must follow that doc).
- **Show 3 variants (A/B/C) in a horizontal carousel, each up to ~120 words.**
- **Footer actions:** "Swipe right to choose" • "Preview full"
- **On select:** lock chosen option_id, show "Saved" toast, auto-expand Stack C.
- **Never blurred (user must choose here).**

### Stack C — Translation (gated bottom-half blur)
- **Tabs (default):** Thinker • Feeler • Sensor • Intuition Toggle: "Show advanced (8)" → Te • Ti • Fe • Fi • Se • Si • Ni • Ne
- **Box layout per tab:** Header (e.g., "If I'm talking to a Thinker"), 2–4 sentence body, bottom 50% blurred. Overlay CTA: "Sign up free to save your personalized results and reveal the full message." (Buttons: Sign up free / Not now)

## 4) The 16 Brain-wave profiles
We show Lead → Next using your public labels. People never see letters. The 2–3 sentence descriptions avoid boxing anyone in.

| MBTI | Lead → Next (public labels) | Friendly name | Expanded description |
|------|------------------------------|---------------|---------------------|
| ESFP | Pulse → Compass (Se→Fi) | Artist | Leads with real-time sensing and read-of-the-room; steadies decisions by checking what feels true and aligned. Thrives when there's something tangible to react to and freedom to choose. |
| ESTP | Pulse → Kernel (Se→Ti) | Tuner | Leads with hands-on reality and fast troubleshooting; steadies by tightening the model until it makes sense. Best in live, moving situations where testing beats theorizing. |
| ENFP | Spark → Compass (Ne→Fi) | Storyteller | Leads with possibilities and new angles; steadies by filtering through personal meaning and values. Energized by open space, discouraged by boxes and stale rules. |
| ENTP | Spark → Kernel (Ne→Ti) | Inventor | Leads with reframes and options; steadies by refining definitions and logic. Loves prototyping and iterating; skepticism sharpens ideas, not people. |
| ISFJ | Anchor → Chorus (Si→Fe) | Caretaker | Leads with what's proven and trusted; steadies by tending to people and expectations. Safety grows from clarity, traditions, and dependable follow-through. |
| ISTJ | Anchor → Forge (Si→Te) | Organizer | Leads with reliable facts/history; steadies by structuring plans, roles, and timelines. Operates best when goals are clear and the path is tested. |
| INFJ | Horizon → Chorus (Ni→Fe) | Guide | Leads with deep patterns and long arcs; steadies by aligning relationships and tone. Protects coherence and purpose; needs space to see the through-line. |
| INTJ | Horizon → Forge (Ni→Te) | Strategist | Leads with trajectories and synthesis; steadies by locking systems, owners, and outcomes. At their best when vision maps to execution. |
| ESFJ | Chorus → Anchor (Fe→Si) | Host | Leads with people, tone, and belonging; steadies with what's worked before. Keeps groups coordinated and cared for; clarifies expectations early. |
| ESTJ | Forge → Anchor (Te→Si) | Manager | Leads with outcomes and structure; steadies with proven steps and examples. Drives delivery and accountability; fairness shows in consistency. |
| ENFJ | Chorus → Horizon (Fe→Ni) | Orchestrator | Leads by reading and moving people; steadies by sensing the bigger pattern. Rallies momentum around meaning; needs open feedback loops. |
| ENTJ | Forge → Horizon (Te→Ni) | Commander | Leads with decisive plans; steadies by orienting to long-path direction. Mobilizes teams; wants signal over noise and decisions that stick. |
| ISFP | Compass → Pulse (Fi→Se) | Maker | Leads with inner values and taste; steadies by touching reality and crafting. Needs authenticity and room to build what feels right. |
| ISTP | Kernel → Pulse (Ti→Se) | Fixer | Leads with clean internal logic; steadies by testing in the real world. Calm under pressure; prefers precision over performance. |
| INFP | Compass → Spark (Fi→Ne) | Sage-Maker | Leads with meaning and integrity; steadies by exploring options and metaphors. Protects what matters; flourishes when there's time to imagine. |
| INTP | Kernel → Spark (Ti→Ne) | Analyst | Leads with models and distinctions; steadies by exploring alternative frames. Needs time to think and space to adjust the map. |

## 5) Brain "regions / data streams" table (for the "More info" modal)
This keeps the science-y feel your explainer promises ("different regions focus on different kinds of information" → logical patterns, sensory details, emotional values, abstract possibilities).

| Channel | Public label | "What this stream is" |
|---------|--------------|----------------------|
| Se | Pulse | Live sensory signal: what's happening now, what can be touched, tried, or moved. |
| Si | Anchor | Stored signal: records, routines, what's proven/repeatable; practical memory. |
| Ne | Spark | Option signal: new angles, emerging patterns, "what else could this be?" |
| Ni | Horizon | Trajectory signal: deep patterns, implications, "where this seems to go." |
| Te | Forge | External structure: roles, metrics, timelines; how we ship and measure. |
| Ti | Kernel | Internal structure: precise models/definitions; why something holds up. |
| Fe | Chorus | Social field: tone, belonging, relational impact; what keeps "us" safe. |
| Fi | Compass | Inner value: personal meaning, integrity, what rings true/non-negotiable. |

One-liner under the table (reuse your voice): "Everyone has access to every stream, but we start from a few that feel most reliable—your processing fingerprint."

## 6) Core Fear set (names + plain definitions)
- **Abandonment / Exclusion** — fear of being left, ignored, or not included.
- **Unlovable / Rejection** — fear that if seen, I won't be wanted.
- **Unworthy / Shame** — fear there's something defective/wrong about me.
- **Incompetence / Failure** — fear I don't have what it takes.
- **Powerlessness / Loss of control** — fear I can't influence the outcome.
- **Betrayal / Mistrust** — fear others will violate or use me.
- **Confinement / Trapped** — fear my freedom/choice will be boxed.
- **Chaos / Uncertainty** — fear of instability; anything could go wrong.

(Framed in your explainer as the automatic "coping code" that protects old wounds—busy, please-everyone, stay in control, etc.)

## Translation Templates (what the AI writes)
**Important:** The Translation must follow the selected WIMTS content (Stack B). Do not contradict the user's core intent; adapt framing only.

### Default 4-listener set
- **Thinker (T)** — Explain: Definition → Logic chain → Edge case (1) → Check "I'm defining X as __ because __. That leads to __. Does that hold?"
- **Feeler (F)** — Belong: Relational safety → Shared aim → Small ask "I want us okay while we sort this. I'm after __ with you."
- **Sensor (S)** — Concrete: Current facts → Example/receipt → Next step "Right now we have __. Last time __ worked. Next, could we __?"
- **Intuition (N)** — Pattern: Through-line → Options → Preferred path → Invite "This fits a pattern: __ → __. Options are __; I'd choose __. Thoughts?"

### Advanced 8-listener set
- **Te (Planner):** Outcome → Owner → When → Risk/mitigation
- **Ti (Analyzer):** Definition → Premise → Inference → Counterexample
- **Fe (People-First):** Acknowledge → We-goal → Smooth path → Small ask
- **Fi (Values-First):** Value → Integrity check → Choice
- **Se (Hands-On):** What's happening now → Try it → Show result
- **Si (Tried-&-True):** What's worked → Steps → Consistency
- **Ni (Trajectory):** Meaning → Trajectory → Focused step
- **Ne (Options):** Reframe → 2–3 options → Pick one

### Shared rules (4 & 8):
- 2–4 sentences (≈45–90 words).
- Address Top Frictions gently (Rulebook → receipts/steps; Subtext → name the implication once).
- Neutral, concrete language; no therapy jargon.

## 7) Scoring Model
Buckets: 8 pressure (Se/Ne/Si/Ni/Te/Ti/Fe/Fi), 16 type, 8 fears. Intensity: Up=+2, Down=+1; "Neither" adds +0.5 smoothing to both options.

### Function pressure updates
- Q1: Se / Ne +1.0×int
- Q2: Si / Ni +1.0×int
- Q2b: Te / Ti +1.0×int
- Q2c: Fe / Fi +1.0×int

### Type narrowing
- Largest pressure bucket → inferior → pair (table above).
- Q4 pair split: winner +4 (Up) / +2 (Down); runner-up +1.
- Confidence = winner / (winner+runner-up) × 100.

### Core Fear crosswalk
- As defined in the Card Bank under Q1–Q7.
- Normalize to % for display; show Top-3.

```

## 7) Example flows (rewritten, 5–8 cards, with UI + weights)
All cards include an "i" helper and support Up/Down intensity.

### Flow A — Work stand-up (timeline pressure)
**User story:** "…put on the spot about the timeline; I froze and left annoyed."
- Q1: Which pressure felt bigger? Left Put on the spot now (→ Se +1.0×int; fears: Powerlessness .4, Incompetence .3, Unworthy .2, Chaos .1) Right Too many moving parts (→ Ne +1.0×; fears: Chaos .45, Incompetence .25, Powerlessness .2, Betrayal .1)
- Q2: What kind of judgment landed? Left Wanted exact steps & proof (→ Si +1.0×; fears: Confinement .4, Unworthy .3, Incompetence .2, Abandonment .1) Right Made it about what this means (→ Ni +1.0×; fears: Incompetence .35, Unworthy .25, Confinement .2, Betrayal .2)
- (If needed) Q2b Numbers vs logic.
- Engine: pick inferior → pair (likely Se-inferior → INFJ/INTJ).
- Q4 (pair split INFJ vs INTJ): Left Make the room okay (→ Fe; Type +2/+4; fears Abandonment .5, Unlovable .3, Betrayal .2) Right Lock owners & steps (→ Te; Type +2/+4; fears Incompetence .5, Chaos .3, Powerlessness .2)
- Q5 Fear lock: Left Unwanted / not included vs Right Not capable / not right
- (Tie) Q6 Freedom boxed vs Felt unstable
- Summary confirm (only if confidence <70% or Top-2 fears ≤2 pts).

### Flow B — "We need to talk" text
**User story:** "They texted 'we need to talk.' I spiraled."
- Q1: Cornered to talk tonight ⟷ Not knowing what's coming
- Q2: Didn't follow through ⟷ This says something big about us
- Pair computed; Q4 split (e.g., ENFJ vs ESFJ or INFJ vs INTJ): We're okay / good intent ⟷ Plan: when/how/decide
- Q5 Fear lock: Pull away/leave ⟷ I'm the problem / not enough
- Tie-breakers if needed; summary confirm.

### Flow C — Family holiday change
**User story:** "I suggested switching houses; it turned into drama."
- Q1: Everyone staring—answer now ⟷ Too many moving parts
- Q2: We always do it this way ⟷ This shows what you think of us
- Pair computed; Q4 split: Same page emotionally ⟷ Checklist & who does what
- Q5 Fear lock: Left out by my people ⟷ Messing it up / not capable
- Tie-breakers if needed; summary confirm.

## 8) Writer rules (keep copy specific and universal)
- Plain words, concrete pictures; swap jargon for images users live in.
- One idea per option; clean opposites.
- ≤8 words headline/choice; optional micro-subtitle ≤30 chars.
- Mirror inner voice; "I felt not chosen / not capable."
- Name the felt sense of threat, not the theory.
- Domain skins: work / romance / family / friends nouns swap-in.
- Gesture carries intensity; keep words neutral.
- Symmetry & rhythm in Left/Right to avoid bias.
- Always include a human vs structure split somewhere (great for Q4).

## 9) Designer checklist (so nothing is missed)
- **Intake:** rotating prompt field + permanent "i" helper; long text area; privacy note.
- **Cards:** two choices, Up/Down intensity, "i" helper, "Neither."
- **Feedback strip under each card:** two Style chips (Lead→Next finalists), Top fears mini-bar.
- **Results:** headline Lead → Next, Mode pill, 2–3 sentence expanded description, Friction chips, Core Fear Top-3 + stacked bar, 3-line micro-coaching, and a short context capsule referencing the user's story.
- **Accordion:** three stacks (A→B→C). Soft shadow, 200ms ease-in/out.
- **Auto-collapse:** Stack A collapses after 3s or on scroll.
- **3-card carousel (B):** next card peeks 32–48px; bottom edge of all cards visible.
- **Blur:** bottom 50% of Translation text (C) with gradient overlay; screen-reader label: "Partially hidden—sign up to reveal."
- **Tabs:** 4 default; toggle to 8. Active tab underline persists.
- **Accessibility:** readable contrast, large tap targets, and equal option lengths (avoid bias).
- **Tone:** neutral, direct, a little warm—never slangy or clinical.

## Admin Controls & Tuning — Intake (5–8 Question Flow)
**Purpose:** give ops/design/research the knobs to tweak questions, weights, and logic without code deploys. All fields are versioned and audit-logged; changes apply to new sessions only.

### A) Question Bank & Copy
- **Questions[]** (editable list)
  - id (string)
  - headline (text, ≤8 words)
  - left.label / right.label (text, ≤8 words)
  - left.subtitle / right.subtitle (text, ≤30 chars)
  - helper_text ("i" popover, one sentence)
  - domains_enabled (multi: work/relationship/family/friends/all)
  - **Mapping (per option):**
    - function (one of: Se/Ne/Si/Ni/Te/Ti/Fe/Fi)
    - function_weight (default 1.0; range 0.1–3.0)
    - fear_deltas (object of {fear_name: weight}, e.g., { "powerlessness": 0.4 })
    - branch_rules (when to surface this card; keyword triggers; min/max position)
    - enabled (bool)
  - A/B Variants for Q1/Q2 copies (toggle; % allocation)
  - Banned_words (list; redacts/rewrites copy if present)
  - Readability_target (grade 6–8; enforce/flag)

### B) Flow & Branching Logic
- min_cards (default 5), max_cards (default 8)
- **Branching thresholds**
  - weak_answer_threshold (e.g., intensity=1 + "Neither" → insert Q2b/Q2c)
  - insert_social_card_if_keywords (list: "tone", "approval", "liked", etc.)
- **Regeneration rules (if you allow swapping a card mid-flow)**
  - allow_regen (bool), regen_cooldown_sec (default 10)

### C) Scoring & Confidence
- Intensity map: up=2, down=1, neither_smoothing=0.5
- Function bucket weights (global multipliers per Se/Ne/…; default 1.0)
- Inferior→Pair table (editable mapping; CSV/JSON)
- Pair split scoring: winner_up=+4, winner_down=+2, runner_up=+1
- **Confidence thresholds**
  - summary_confirm_min_confidence (default 0.70)
  - require_tiebreak_if_top2_gap_lt (points; default 2)

### D) Fear Model
- Crosswalk editor (per card & per option)
  - e.g., Q1.left (Se): { powerlessness: .4, incompetence: .3, unworthy: .2, chaos: .1 }
- Normalization: method=softmax|sum (default sum)
- Display_config: top_n=3, show_percent=true

### E) Copy Skins & Localization
- Domain_skinning (swap nouns per domain)
- Locale packs (per language; keys mirror Question Bank)

### F) QA & Safety
- Dry-run harness (seed text → preview flow & scores)
- Snapshot tests (freeze outputs for regression)
- Moderation rules (PII redaction on intake; profanity filter on copies)
- Rate limits: max_sessions_per_user_per_day

### G) Feedback to AI (observability)
- Admin review panel (see session transcript; mark "misclassify", "copy unclear", "trigger wrong")
- Inline corrective nudge (optional notes the model reads next retrain cycle)
- Export (CSV of answers, scores, final type, fears, feedback)

## Precedence
If any instruction in this addendum conflicts with earlier instructions in the feature doc, this addendum's parameters and behaviors take priority on the Intro/Intake Translate page only. The Core Spec remains the single source of truth for generation rules; this page sets how the Core is invoked.

## Intro & Usage Addendum — Intro/Intake Translate Page
**What this is** The Intro/Intake Translate page is a lightweight entry point that lets a user draft a clean, recipient-ready message fast. It reuses the same WIMTS & Translator Core you documented, but runs with a simplified surface: single intake field → one WIMTS passage → 4 listener translations (Thinker, Feeler, Sensor, Intuition). No signup gating on this page.

### Recommendation: single source of truth + parameterized reference
- Keep one canonical WIMTS spec (the
- In your Intro/Intake Translate page doc, link to that spec and pass the few differences as parameters (e.g., "translation_mode=4", "show_validation_intro=false", "gating=on", etc.).
- This avoids drift and ensures both places always call the same generation logic.

### Paste-in block for the Intro/Intake Translate page
Use this verbatim (or tweak lightly). It gives the AI and engineers everything they need without copying the full WIMTS content.

#### Spec dependency
This page depends on the canonical: What I really meant to say & Translator — Core Spec (v1.x)
- Section: Embedded WIMTS Playbook (Voice, Validation Intro, WIMTS Assembly, Distinctiveness Engine, Translator styles, Never-do list, Variation rules)
- Section: WIMTS Distinctiveness Engine + Phrase Pools

**Contract:** This page imports the above capabilities and changes only the parameters documented here.

#### Scope of this page
- **Purpose:** On intake, let users draft a clean message that lands, using the same WIMTS + Translator engines.
- **Differences from Core Spec:**
  - Translations show 4 listeners only: Thinker, Feeler, Sensor, Intuition.
  - (No Advanced 8-tab toggle on this page.)
  - Gating: None — full text visible on this page.
  - Validation intro: optional (default off here to keep it snappy).
  - No 3-card chooser step (optional toggle; see parameter below).

#### Parameters (pass to the Core feature)
```json
{
  "feature": "WIMTS_Translator",
  "version": "1.x",
  "page_id": "intro_translate",
  "params": {
    "translation_mode": "4",         // "4" = Thinker/Feeler/Sensor/Intuition
    "show_advanced_toggle": false,   // hide 8-function set
    "show_validation_intro": false,  // default off on this page (can A/B test true)
    "show_wimts_chooser": false,     // set true if you *do* want the 3-card chooser here
    "gating": "off",                 // fully visible outputs on this page
    "length_bounds": {               // tighter, snackable variant
      "wimts_min_words": 60,
      "wimts_max_words": 100,
      "translate_min_sentences": 2,
      "translate_max_sentences": 4
    }
  }
}
```

#### UI summary (Intro/Intake Translate page)
- **Single intake field (as finalized):** "In one short paragraph, tell me who you're talking to, what just happened (or the last frustrating moment this week), and what you want them to understand." "i" helper always-on: "Detail helps: your feelings, exact words, frustrations, what you noticed (tone, choices), what you needed, what you felt or thought."
- **Output area (stacked):**
  - What I really meant to say (WIMTS) — single refined passage (since show_wimts_chooser=false here).
  - Translation (4 tabs): Thinker • Feeler • Sensor • Intuition — each shows a concise rewrite (2–4 sentences), no blur.
  - Actions: Copy buttons per section; "Try again" (re-generate with same params), "Edit context" (returns to field), optional A/B Test switch for show_validation_intro.

#### AI instructions (how to call the Core)
- **Build WIMTS by calling the Core WIMTS assembly with:**
  - Required slots: Emotion + Need/Longing
  - Optional slots: 2–3, keeping within 60–100 words.
  - End with open invitation (closer).
  - If show_wimts_chooser=true here, request 3 variants (A/B/C) and enforce distinctiveness rules; otherwise request 1 (auto-picked human/structure blend).
- **Build Translation (4) from the selected or single WIMTS:**
  - Thinker (T) — Definition → Logic chain → Edge case → Check
  - Feeler (F) — Relational safety → Shared aim → Small ask
  - Sensor (S) — Current facts → Example/receipt → Next step
  - Intuition (N) — Through-line → Options → Preferred path → Invite Rules: 2–4 sentences; preserve the WIMTS meaning; neutral tone; end with a gentle check.
- **Personalization hooks (optional if available on this page):**
  - If a role is provided in the paragraph (e.g., "boss," "partner"), prefer role-based nuances in phrasing.
  - If a Top Friction is known from prior sessions, apply a micro-adjust (e.g., add receipts/steps for Rulebook, name implication once for Subtext).

#### Pseudo-API (example)
```javascript
// 1) Generate WIMTS
const wimts = generateWIMTS({
  intake_text,
  profile,          // if available; else omit
  params: {
    chooser: false,
    minWords: 60, maxWords: 100,
    showValidationIntro: false
  }
});

// 2) Generate 4 translations from WIMTS
const translations = generateTranslations({
  base_text: wimts.body,
  mode: "4",       // T/F/S/N
  persona_hints: { role: "boss" } // optional
});

return { wimts, translations };
```

#### Analytics (lightweight for this page)
- intro_translate_intake_submitted
- intro_translate_wimts_generated
- intro_translate_translation_tab_viewed (Thinker/Feeler/Sensor/Intuition)
- intro_translate_copy_clicked

#### Acceptance criteria
- One-field intake → WIMTS (≤2s p95) → 4 translations.
- WIMTS includes Emotion + Need, ends invitationally, 60–100 words.
- Each translation adheres to its pattern; no contradictions with WIMTS; 2–4 sentences; neutral tone.
- No gating or blur on this page; tabs switch instantly.

#### "Link wording" you can drop into the doc
**Short form (for spec headers):** This page uses the WIMTS & Translator — Core Spec (v1.x). It calls the same engines with translation_mode=4 and show_wimts_chooser=false. All voice, assembly, distinctiveness, and "never do" rules are inherited from the Core Spec.

**Inline reference (where you mention generation):** "Generate the 'What I really meant to say' passage by invoking the Core WIMTS assembly (see Embedded WIMTS Playbook). Then generate four listener translations (Thinker/Feeler/Sensor/Intuition) from that exact passage, using the Core Translator pattern rules."
