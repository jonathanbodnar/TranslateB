## Overview
Cognitive distortions are irrational thought patterns that can lead to negative thinking, emotional distress, and poor decision-making. Understanding these patterns is crucial for developing healthier thought processes and improving communication.

## The 10 Cognitive Distortions

### 1. All-or-Nothing Thinking (Black and White Thinking)
**Description:** Viewing situations in extreme, absolute terms with no middle ground.

**Examples:**
- "I'm either perfect or I'm a complete failure."
- "If I can't do this perfectly, I shouldn't do it at all."
- "They either love me completely or they don't love me at all."

**Impact on Communication:**
- Creates unrealistic expectations
- Leads to harsh self-criticism
- Makes compromise difficult
- Can cause relationship conflicts

**Healthy Alternative:**
- Recognize shades of gray
- Accept imperfection as part of being human
- Focus on progress rather than perfection
- Practice self-compassion

### 2. Overgeneralization
**Description:** Drawing broad conclusions from a single event or limited evidence.

**Examples:**
- "I always mess up relationships."
- "Nobody ever understands me."
- "I can never do anything right."

**Impact on Communication:**
- Creates self-fulfilling prophecies
- Limits willingness to try new approaches
- Reduces hope for positive change
- Can lead to social isolation

**Healthy Alternative:**
- Look for exceptions to the rule
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Focus on specific situations rather than global patterns
- Practice evidence-based thinking

### 3. Mental Filtering

### 4. Disqualifying the Positive
**Description:** Dismissing or minimizing positive experiences, achievements, or feedback.

**Examples:**

- "They're just being nice to me."

**Impact on Communication:**
- Undermines self-worth

**Healthy Alternative:**

### 5. Jumping to Conclusions

**Description:** Believing that feelings reflect objective reality.

**Healthy Alternative:**

### 8. Should Statements
