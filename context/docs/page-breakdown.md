## Page Breakdown

### 1) Landing / Intro Hook
**Purpose:** First impression, sets the emotional tone and promise.

**What's on it:**
- Some Sort of Unique Hook, idea below but missing the pop/interaction I'm going for
- Bold tagline (micro-copy like: "The living mirror for what you really mean.")
- Sub-line: promise of soul-level connection, clarity, being truly seen.
- Elegant background animation.
- CTA to "Start my Mirror" or "Begin."

**Tone:** Poetic, minimalist, emotionally inviting. Interactive, Unique

### 2) Onboarding Quiz ("Soul Profile")
**Purpose:** Quickly generate an individualized starting profile.

**What's on it:**
- Card-swipe style questions (fears, coping, lens, tone).
- Rotating phrasing + icons so users can "find their words."
- Tap/hold sliders for resonance intensity.
- Abbreviated option (5â€“7 cards) vs. "deeper deck."
- (Jon's Idea) way to track progress (buckets/bars filling)/ see results immediately as they go
- (Jon's Idea) social component = way to feel part of my groupâ€¦(X number of people answered that same way and narrows until gets to your group)
- Possibly want an OUTPUT/result? Card with your metrics?
- Confirmation mirror: soft reflection of what the AI heard for them to rate (with a link to a more in depth one if prefer)?

**Tone:** Playful, exploratory, not test-like.

To Save results and try a translationâ€¦

**Sample**
- 4 types of general translations
- This is how you talk to a deep thinker, feeler (talks too damn much, where's his emotions on his sleeve) use 3 simple Identifying factor
- This is how they are likely to misunderstand
- Do you want this to translate to your exact person? Have them download the app

### 2b) Create Account/Sign In Page
**Purpose:** Gate entry, but styled to feel elegant and unique.

**What's on it:**
- Create account. (make unique, pretty, different)
- Age-gate & consent/ legal (if needed, presented in plain, non-legalese language, plus link to details).
- (For non- new users) Social sign-in + email/password option.
- Design: visually distinct (not generic login form) â†’ could be vertical card stacks, gradient overlay, subtle animations.

**Tone:** Seamless, feels like part of the experience, not a bureaucratic step.

### 3) Relational Web (Network)
**Purpose:** Map of who you communicate with, and their profiles.

**What's on it:**
- Interactive web/constellation or list of contacts.

- When you click on them â†’ icons take you to:
  - Translate page with them set as recipient
  - Message/Chat page with them set as recipient
- Per-contact settings: mini-quiz to refine their profile, sensitivities, closeness slider. More open AI chat with questions to free form enter info
- Toggle: "Info I logged for them" vs. "Info they shared with me."
- Relationship Health Snapshot:
  - Mini-report: what lands, what misfires, their most common longings.
  - Gentle nudge: "When Alex hears frustration, they often interpret it as rejection. Try leading with appreciation."

**Tone:** Feels like an intimate map of your relational world, not a contact list.

**Purpose:** In-app messaging if both users are on the app.
